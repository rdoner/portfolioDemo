          ...fullstack web developer from Tucson, AZ who currently resides in Boulder, Colorado. In
          2015, I graduated from The University of Arizona with a BS in Neuroscience and Cognitive
          Sciences. After college, I explored a few different career paths while teaching myself web
          development. In 2018, I completed a 6 month web developer apprenticeship program with the
          Techtonic Group in Boulder. For our classroom project I was the team lead for an app built
          using the MERN stack and I later worked on a React Native app for a client. I'm passionate
          about learning new things which I express through my passions for web development, rock
          climbing and scuba diving. I'm currently looking for a full time position as a web
          developer in the Boulder-Denver Metro area.
